% After that, check with

% Use PDF figures!!! (for some reason EPS figures are not displayed correctly, 
% you can use 'epspdf myfigure.eps' to convert)

% Set packages 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\usepackage{lipsum} % for dummy text
\usepackage{todonotes} % for dummy image


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)
% \usepackage{graphicx}
% \usepackage{color}
% \usepackage{url}
% \usepackage{epsfig}
% \usepackage{epstopdf}
% \usepackage{verbatim}



%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set font 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\ifxetexorluatex
    \usepackage{fontspec} % only use it with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, recommended. -- Shanhe
    \setmainfont{Arial}
\else
    % %%-- This is how to set Arial font using LaTeX or PdfLaTeX, not recommended. -- Shanhe
    % %% If you don't install the font into tex packages, then you will just get Computer Modern font.
    % %% How to install uarial package in Mac OS (required MacTeX, /Library/TeX/texbin in your path). *nix with TexLive should be similar. - Shanhe
    % %%   1. curl --remote-name https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
    % %%   2. sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
    % %%   3. sudo getnonfreefonts --sys -a
    % %% Then uncommen the following two lines.
    % \usepackage{uarial}
    % \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
\fi


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% Set indent 
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
% The wmthesis class is based on the latex report class which
% only indents paragraphs if they immediately follow other paragraphs.  The
% dissertation lady says this is wrong.  I tend to give more credence
% to Dr. Knuth (author of TeX) on this issue, since the other way looks really
% crappy.  If you want the first line of every paragraph indented,
% uncomment the next line to include the indentfirst package. -- rem
% Not sure if this is still an option -- Ruth
% Not an issue any more, but I keep this line in case -- Shanhe
% \usepackage{indentfirst}
